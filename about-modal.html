        <b>Introduction:</b><br>
        <p>
          'Capturing Medieval London: A Trail' is an online exhibition showcasing the outputs of a photo walk that took place on March 15th 2024. The walk started at St Giles Cripplegate, touching The City Wall and St Alphage Gardens, and passing through the remains of the Tower of St. Elsyng Spital and into the yard of the London Guildhall, immersing ourselves in the soundscapes of Cheapside, surveying and reflecting on St. Paul’s Cathedral, then heading down towards the Thames Path, along past the Queenhithe Mosaic and Dock, taking note of Walbrook Wharf, up to London Bridge and St. Magnus the Martyr Church before arriving at our final destination at All Hallows by the Tower.<br><br>

          However, just like the first collections of Chaucers Canterbury Tales, this online exhibition has no fixed order, is perpetually unfinished and remains open to interpretation. So, as a viewer, allow for your eye, for your own perspective, to shape the way you view the medieval remains of London and your interaction with the contemporary city. Each click of an image allows you to look closer at the juxtapositions of medieval and contemporary. The photographers were encouraged to see and think with their camera while attempting to capture responses to questions such as: how can we use the camera, use modern technology to position ourselves as spectators to the Middle Ages? How do we capture multiple temporalities? Can we capture sound through image? How do we capture fragments and reveal new narratives of these sites? How do we ‘make’ an image?<br><br>

          The exhibition is just one component of a wider critical project that seeks to offer new understandings of the ways the Middle Ages have been layered within and continue to be made present within contemporary culture. This project focuses on seven key thematic areas: temporal layers, repair and reuse, remains, soundscape, perspective, recreations, and collage. This is less a study of how historical sites including St Paul’s Cathedral, Tabard Street, Cheapside, or Guildhall are ‘survivals’, and more an examination of how these places interact with the temporally stratified city and the consistent onlookers that surround them. This project demonstrates that we might see the modern city through a medieval lens, and it thinks with the photographer and the photograph to examine how the medieval might look back at us.<br><br>

        <p>
          Dr Charlotte Rudman is a writer and researcher from London and has just completed an Inclusion, Participation and Engagement Fellowship with The School of Advanced Study, London. She works on the poetry of Chaucer in the fields of contemporary medievalism, sound studies, materialism and speculative fiction. Her current research project, ‘Capturing the Medieval City: Framing and Perspective’, uncovers the remaining material fragments of medieval London through contemporary photography. The project seeks to expose the connections between the Middle Ages (and Chaucer’s time especially) and now through the viewing perspective of the photographer and through photographic documentation. Critically, it seeks to offer new understandings of how the medieval city exists in and through places that are layered temporally – and it argues that the photograph reveals how these places are framed in the contemporary. She received her PhD for ‘Listening to Dreams: Sound in Chaucer’s Dream Vision Poetry’ from King’s College London in 2022. That project examined Chaucer’s knowledge of the science of sound in his dream vision and dream vehicle poems, arguing that Chaucer’s scientific knowledge of echo and motion were key to his construction of dreams. She has appeared on a special programme for BBC Radio 4 entitled A Dream Vision for Our Times, taught on modules across the Middle Ages at KCL and has published poetry with ‘The Still Point’, The Royal Society of Literature and in Glean & Graft, an anthology from Fresher Publishing.<br>
